# Test Driven Development FizzBuzz

This repository contains a simple program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, implementing the well-known FizzBuzz game. For multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz," and for numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz."

## Implementation

The program was written using the Test Driven Development (TDD) approach. The tests were crafted prior to writing the actual code, ensuring a systematic and reliable development process. The tests provided the specifications, and the code was then created to meet these specifications.

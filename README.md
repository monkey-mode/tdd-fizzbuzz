#Test Driven Development FizzBuzz

#This is a simple program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".

#This program was written using the Test Driven Development approach. The tests were written first and then the code was written to pass the tests.
